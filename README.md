## overview

> gdbg: *get dexcom blood glucose*

a python app that displays blood glucose in the macos menu bar. retrieves blood glucose from dexcom via the [pydexcom](https://github.com/gagebenne/pydexcom) library. it also writes the blood glucose and trend arrow to a state file that can be used for displaying data in your terminal (or anything else you want).

this app was inspired by [kylebshr/luka-mini](https://github.com/kylebshr/luka-mini/tree/main). this is a __fantastic__ app and would recommend for people who want a seamless app experience. i wanted to be able to access the blood glucose data outside of the app for other uses.

## how to use

### file resources

all resources are in the directory: `$HOME/.dexcom`

#### secrets file

*__this file must be created manually__*

* `dexcom_credentials.json`

```json
{
  "username" : "dexcom_username",
  "password": "dexcom_password"
}
```

#### blood glucose state files

these files are generated by the app

* `bg_status.txt`

### build app

NOTE: using [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/#command-line-install) on macos

```sh
# (1) virtual environment
conda create --name gdbg python=3.11
conda activate gdbg

# (2) install requirements
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# (3) build app
python setup.py py2app -A
```

### add to macos login items

TODO: how to

### using in zsh $PROMPT

to use in zsh prompt, update `$PROMPT` in `$HOME/.zshrc`. the backslash when setting `$PROMPT` to execute the function to read the bg text file is __critical__ (will not work otherwise).

```sh
# $HOME/.zshrc

function get_bg() {
    RED='\033[91m'
    GREEN='\033[92m'
    YELLOW='\033[93m'
    END='\033[0m'

    bg_status=$(cat $HOME/.dexcom/bg_status.txt)
    value=$(echo "$bg_status" | cut -d' ' -f1)

    if [[ $value -ge 80 && $value -le 180 ]]; then
        color="$GREEN"
    elif [[ $value -gt 180 ]]; then
        color="$YELLOW"
    elif [[ $value -lt 80 ]]; then
        color="$RED"
    fi

    echo "${color}${bg_status}${END}"
}

export PROMPT="$PROMPT\$(get_bg)"
```

### known issues

when building, if getting the error that the library `libffi.8.dylib` is missing, you can install it with `brew`.

```sh
brew install libffi
```
