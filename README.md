## overview

> gdbg: *get dexcom blood glucose*

a python app that displays blood glucose in the macos menu bar. retrieves blood glucose from dexcom via the [pydexcom](https://github.com/gagebenne/pydexcom) library. it also writes the blood glucose and arrow (with terminal colors) to a state file that can be used for displaying data in your terminal.

this app was inspire by [kylebshr/luka-mini](https://github.com/kylebshr/luka-mini/tree/main). i wanted to be able to access the blood glucose data outside of the app for other uses.

## how to use

### file resources

all resources are in the directory: `$HOME/.dexcom`

#### secrets file

this file must be created manually

* `dexcom_credentials.json`

```json
{
  "username" : "dexcom_username",
  "password": "dexcom_password"
}
```

#### blood glucose state files

these files are generated by the app

* `bg_status.txt`
* `bg_color_status.txt`

### build app

TODO: note that this needs to be built in conda env with everything installed (so maybe dev section doesn't need to exist...)

```sh
python setup.py py2app
```

### add to macos login items

TODO: how to

## development

NOTE: using [anaconda](https://gist.github.com/ryanorsinger/7d89ad58901b5590ec3e1f23d7b9f887) on macos

```sh
r
conda activate gdbg  

pip uninstall setuptools # need an older version
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt 

# DEBUG
dist/gdbg.app/Contents/MacOS/gdbg

# solution if issue with `@rpath/libffi.8.dylib`
ln -sf /opt/homebrew/opt/libffi/lib/libffi.8.dylib /usr/local/lib/
```

## using in zsh $PROMPT

to use in zsh prompt, update `$PROMPT` in `$HOME/.zshrc`. the backslash when setting `$PROMPT` to execute the function to read the bg text file is __critical__ (will not work otherwise).

```sh
# $HOME/.zshrc

function get_bg() {
    cat $HOME/.dexcom/bg_color_status.txt
}

export PROMPT="$PROMPT\$(get_bg)"
```

## TODO:

* [ ] logic for time interval (rumps has thing, but luka-mini has dynamic approach - can they be mixed)
  * [ ] will need to fallback to 10 min if no timestamp available
  * [ ] show how many minutes since last retrieved
  * [ ] handle these cases:
    * [ ] icon for no recent readings
    * [ ] icon for retrying in 10 min
* [ ] have it start as login item
